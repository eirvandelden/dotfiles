# SteamOS / Steam Deck input.conf (Omarchy-aligned, Deck-tuned)
#
# This file follows Omarchy’s split-config approach (input lives in its own file),
# but is tuned for the Steam Deck’s built-in controls (trackpads + touchscreen).
#
# References:
# - Omarchy default input.conf:
#   https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/blob/master/config/hypr/input.conf
# - Hyprland input variables:
#   https://wiki.hypr.land/Configuring/Variables/#input
#
# Notes:
# - The Steam Deck’s trackpads typically appear as touchpads/pointers; Steam Input
#   may also emulate mouse input depending on your layout.
# - Keep settings conservative; Steam Input profiles vary.
# - If you feel the cursor is too slow/fast, tweak `sensitivity`.

  # Omarchy default uses compose:caps (compose key on CapsLock).
  # (On Steam Deck this is mostly relevant when using an external keyboard.)
  kb_options = compose:caps

  # Omarchy defaults
  repeat_rate = 40
  repeat_delay = 600
  numlock_by_default = true

  # Pointer sensitivity (Hyprland default: 0). Increase slightly if needed.
  # sensitivity = 0.25

    # Steam Deck trackpads: natural scroll tends to feel better with Steam Input.
    natural_scroll = true

    # Omarchy uses a lower scroll_factor for control; keep it but slightly higher
    # to reduce swipes on the Deck.
    scroll_factor = 0.6

    # Two-finger right click is usually more comfortable on trackpads.
    clickfinger_behavior = true

    # Optional: three-finger drag to move windows (can conflict with Steam Input).

# Omarchy adds scrolltouchpad window rules; keep Ghostty behaviour aligned.
# (Ghostty class on Linux is usually `com.mitchellh.ghostty`.)
windowrule = scrolltouchpad 0.2, class:com.mitchellh.ghostty

# If you use other terminals, you can add them here.
# windowrule = scrolltouchpad 1.5, class:(Alacritty|kitty)

# Gestures (optional)
# On Deck, gestures may conflict with Steam Input; keep disabled by default.
# gesture = 3, horizontal, workspace
