# SteamOS / Steam Deck monitors.conf (Omarchy-style split config)
#
# This is intentionally conservative for the Deck LCD and for nested launch
# inside gamescope from Steam Gaming Mode.
#
# See:
# - https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Monitors/
# - hyprctl monitors

# Steam Deck LCD: 1280x800, keep scale at 1 for predictable UI sizing in Game Mode.
# Use a fully specified mode to avoid "preferred" resolving unexpectedly when nested.
env = GDK_SCALE,1
monitor=,1280x800@60,auto,1

# If you dock and want to override externally later, you can add explicit monitor
# lines above and keep this as a fallback.
