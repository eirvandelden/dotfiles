# Customize the macOS app icon.
#
# This only affects the icon that appears in the dock, application
# switcher, etc. This does not affect the icon in Finder because
# that is controlled by a hardcoded value in the signed application
# bundle and can't be changed at runtime. For more details on what
# exactly is affected, see the `NSApplication.icon` Apple documentation;
# that is the API that is being used to set the icon.
#
# WARNING: The `custom-style` option is _experimental_. We may change
# the format of the custom styles in the future. We're still finalizing
# the exact layers and customization options that will be available.
#
# Other caveats:
#
#   * The icon in the update dialog will always be the official icon.
#     This is because the update dialog is managed through a
#     separate framework and cannot be customized without significant
#     effort.
#
# Valid values:
#
#  * `official` - Use the official Ghostty icon.
#  * `blueprint`, `chalkboard`, `microchip`, `glass`, `holographic`,
#    `paper`, `retro`, `xray` - Official variants of the Ghostty icon
#    hand-created by artists (no AI).
#  * `custom-style` - Use the official Ghostty icon but with custom
#    styles applied to various layers. The custom styles must be
#    specified using the additional `macos-icon`-prefixed configurations.
#    The `macos-icon-ghost-color` and `macos-icon-screen-color`
#    configurations are required for this style.

# The opacity level (opposite of transparency) of the background. A value of
# 1 is fully opaque and a value of 0 is fully transparent. A value less than 0
# or greater than 1 will be clamped to the nearest valid value.
#
# On macOS, background opacity is disabled when the terminal enters native
# fullscreen. This is because the background becomes gray and it can cause
# widgets to show through which isn't generally desirable.
#
# On macOS, changing this configuration requires restarting Ghostty completely.

# Whether to blur the background when `background-opacity` is less than 1.
#
# Valid values are:
#
#   * a nonnegative integer specifying the *blur intensity*
#   * `false`, equivalent to a blur intensity of 0
#   * `true`, equivalent to the default blur intensity of 20, which is
#     reasonable for a good looking blur. Higher blur intensities may
#     cause strange rendering and performance issues.
#
# Supported on macOS and on some Linux desktop environments, including:
#
#   * KDE Plasma (Wayland and X11)
#
# Warning: the exact blur intensity is _ignored_ under KDE Plasma, and setting
# this setting to either `true` or any positive blur intensity value would
# achieve the same effect. The reason is that KWin, the window compositor
# powering Plasma, only has one global blur setting and does not allow
# applications to specify individual blur settings.
#
# To configure KWin's global blur setting, open System Settings and go to
# "Apps & Windows" > "Window Management" > "Desktop Effects" and select the
# "Blur" plugin. If disabled, enable it by ticking the checkbox to the left.
# Then click on the "Configure" button and there will be two sliders that
# allow you to set background blur and noise intensities for all apps,
# including Ghostty.
#
# All other Linux desktop environments are as of now unsupported. Users may
# need to set environment-specific settings and/or install third-party plugins
# in order to support background blur, as there isn't a unified interface for
# doing so.

# The opacity level (opposite of transparency) of an unfocused split.
# Unfocused splits by default are slightly faded out to make it easier to see
# which split is focused. To disable this feature, set this value to 1.
#
# A value of 1 is fully opaque and a value of 0 is fully transparent. Because
# "0" is not useful (it makes the window look very weird), the minimum value
# is 0.15. This value still looks weird but you can at least see what's going
# on. A value outside of the range 0.15 to 1 will be clamped to the nearest
# valid value.
