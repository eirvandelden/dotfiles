# packages.conf
#
# Purpose:
# - This file defines runtime-level packages (Ruby gems, npm packages) and
#   non-brew fallback/mismatch lists.
#
# Package installation (system packages/apps) is now driven by GENERATED files:
# - brewfiles/Brewfile.formulae
# - brewfiles/Brewfile.casks          (macOS only)
# - brewfiles/Brewfile.vscode         (best-effort)
# - brewfiles/Flatpakfile             (non-macOS best-effort)
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - Those brewfiles are generated by ./save.sh and will be overwritten.
# - Keep "desired state" for brew installs in your machine(s) and run ./save.sh
#   to refresh the generated files.
#
# When a package is not available in brew (or the name mismatches), use the lists
# below so the installer can fall back to native managers.

# Packages with mismatched names or availability between managers.

# - has a different name on each manager, OR
# - you intentionally want to force one manager on a specific OS.
