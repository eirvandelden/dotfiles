# Flatpakfile
#
# This file is intended to contain Flatpak package refs managed by this repo.
#
# Usage intent:
# - Install only on non-macOS systems (e.g. SteamOS/Arch, Debian).
# - Keep Homebrew formulae in `dotfiles/brewfiles/Brewfile.formulae`.
# - Keep macOS GUI apps (casks) in `dotfiles/brewfiles/Brewfile.casks`.
# - Keep VS Code extensions in `dotfiles/brewfiles/Brewfile.vscode`.
#
# Format:
# - One Flatpak ref per line (remote/ref).
# - Prefer Flathub refs, e.g.:
#     flathub com.discordapp.Discord
#     flathub com.spotify.Client
#
# Notes:
# - Your installer script should ensure Flatpak is installed and that Flathub is added:
#     flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
# - Some apps work better as Flatpaks on Linux (Discord, Spotify, etc.).
#
# Examples (commented):
# flathub com.discordapp.Discord
# flathub com.spotify.Client
# flathub org.mozilla.firefox
