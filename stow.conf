#
# Defines which stow "packages" (directories) should be applied when restoring
# dotfiles. A package is a directory under `CONFIG_STOW_DIR` (defaults to `home/`)
# whose contents map onto $HOME via GNU Stow.
#
# Example:
#   If CONFIG_STOW_DIR=./home and you have:
#     ./home/neovim/.config/nvim/init.lua
#   then including "neovim" below will run:
#     stow --dir ./home --target $HOME --restow neovim
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - Names listed here must correspond to existing directories under CONFIG_STOW_DIR.
# - This file is sourced by the installer; keep it valid bash.

CONFIG_PACKAGES=(
  # Core shell/editor
  zsh
  git
  neovim

  # Add more packages as you create corresponding directories under ./home
  # tmux
  # ssh
)
